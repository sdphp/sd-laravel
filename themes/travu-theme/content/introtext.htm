        <p style="text-align:left;width:75%;margin:auto;">
            This month we will have a couple talks for you Laravel developers out there.<br><br>

            First Eric (@shocm) will discuss some debugging tips and tricks you can use while developing your Laravel app. He'll discuss things such as the power of dd(), using XDebug, and several tricks to see which database calls are being made.<br><br>

            Next Marcus (@marcusamoore) will talk about Laravel Forge. A service that can be used to provision, host, and deploy much more that just Laravel application. Forge will help you manage your environment on services such as AWS, DigitalOcean, and Linode.<br>
